# ABN-Amro-Assignment

This project consists of two parts:
1. A modified Wikipedia iOS app
2. A custom "Places" app that interacts with the modified Wikipedia app

## Setup Instructions

To use this project, please follow these setup steps:

1. **XCode Requirement**
   - Ensure you have XCode 16 or later installed, as this is the minimum version required for the Wikipedia app.

2. **Run Setup Script**
   - Execute the `setup.sh` script to set up the Wikipedia app.
   - If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [official Wikipedia iOS repository](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios) for troubleshooting.

3. **Wikipedia App Setup**
   - Open the Wikipedia app project in XCode.
   - Build and run the app in the iOS simulator to ensure it's properly installed.

4. **Simulator Consistency**
   - Make sure to use the same simulator when running both the Wikipedia app and the Places app.

5. **Running the Places App**
   - Once the Wikipedia app is installed in the simulator, open and run the Places app.
   - You can now use the Places app normally, which will interact with the installed Wikipedia app.
